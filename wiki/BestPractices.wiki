== Best Practices 'auto' provided by gwt-mvc ==
 * LazyPanel : a view is only built when it became visible
 * Bookmarkability
 * Separation of concerns
 * Keep References : By having references on different views, the controller could place each of them multiple times, but only instanciate them once.


== Best Practices when using gwt-mvc ==
 * Display the maximum of elements in the initial html page
 * Notify each asynchronous call by using a maskable
 * Notify each form validation error with a visible sign and an error text
 * Use a controller hierarchy
 * Make a singleton for a shared model
