#summary Differents version release Notes

= v0.0.1 for GWT 1.5.3 =

== Demo ==

In the early start, we'd like to show a real example of how this could work.
So we have two projects: gwt-mvc and gwt-mvc-poc (Proof Of Concept).

== Featuree ==

The main advantages we would like to expose are:
 * The controllers are testables.
 * A controler defines its action by an enum.
 * We recommand to call the action with a prefix but it is not required.
  * SHOW_ to render one or more views
  * DO_ to call an action on the model, eventually a RPC call
  * GET_ to (re)load a model, eventually with a RPC call
  * OPEN_ to open a new popup or window
 * The model updates the views listening him in respect of the asynchronous call.
 * As a view is only a composite (container), it could be a unique componant, or multiple componant(a form for example)
